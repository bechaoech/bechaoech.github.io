    When we first arrived in the U.S., everything felt new — a new place, a new life, and a whole new rhythm to adjust to.
One of the hardest parts was food. Both of us have always loved Vietnamese noodle dishes, but finding that familiar taste here wasn’t easy at all.

Back in Vietnam, we rarely had to cook for ourselves. We often ate out, and if we had meals at home, our mothers were the ones who cooked for us.
But in this new country, it was just the two of us — which meant learning to take care of everything on our own, from figuring out where to shop to cooking our own meals.

In America, everything feels far apart. During those first weeks, we didn’t know where to find Vietnamese food, or even which markets sold the ingredients we needed to recreate the flavors of home.
It was challenging at first, but slowly, we learned. We discovered which Asian markets carried the right sauces, noodles, and herbs that reminded us of home.

Even though we can’t always find every single ingredient, we’ve managed to gather enough to make our small kitchen feel like home again.
Here, I want to share some of the dishes I’ve cooked for my husband — meals from the early days of his PhD journey, simple Vietnamese dishes (and sometimes others) that carried with them a little taste of home.

    When we first moved to the U.S., trying to cook Vietnamese noodle dishes was quite a challenge.
I experimented again and again, hoping to bring back the familiar flavors of the meals we used to enjoy every day in Vietnam.
The dishes weren’t always perfect, but watching my husband smile as he ate made every effort worthwhile.
Seeing him well-fed and a little less homesick always warms my heart.
With a happy stomach, he can now focus wholeheartedly on his PhD — and I feel so grateful to walk beside him on that journey.

      <p class="hf-subtitle">His favorite dish — and the one I cook the most often</p>
      <p class="hf-text">
        I don’t cook it in the Hue style, but rather the Southern version of <em>bun bo</em>, 
      where the broth is richer and slightly sweeter.  
      The key ingredient is shrimp paste — I usually use the 
      <em>Shrimp Sauce (Finely Ground)</em> from Lee Kum Kee, 
      which can easily be found at international or Asian markets in the U.S.  
      Every time I make this dish, the aroma fills our small kitchen with a sense of warmth and familiarity, 
      as if we were back home in Vietnam, enjoying our everyday meals together once again.

      <p class="hf-subtitle">The noodle soup with a ridiculously long name — but a comforting taste</p>
      <p class="hf-text">
 I’m not sure what everyone else calls this dish, but in my family, my mom and grandma 
      always called it “bun ca ... nau ngot,” where the “...” is the type of fish used.  
      Since I usually make it with salmon, I call mine <em>bun ca hoi nau ngot</em>.  
      The broth is cooked with tomatoes and must be served with celery — Vietnamese celery 
      or the Western kind both work, but without it, the dish just doesn’t smell right.  
      It also takes quite a bit of fish sauce; in fact, one time I finished cooking and realized 
      I had used nearly <strong>a third of a brand-new bottle</strong>...  
      But honestly, that rich, savory flavor was absolutely worth it! 😄

      <p class="hf-subtitle">A coastal specialty from Phu Quoc that has found its way all the way to Maryland</p>
      <p class="hf-text">
      Bun Quay in the U.S. is a little different from the one back in Vietnam.
It’s really hard to find calamansi here, so I have to completely replace it with lime.
The bun quay that we used to eat in Saigon was made with freshly pressed noodles, and the broth came straight from the water used to cook them.
Here in the U.S., I usually sauté shrimp heads and shells with a bit of minced garlic before adding them to the pot for the broth, since the noodles I can buy here are the pre-made “fresh-dry” type.
I also can’t find ca thac lac (featherback fish), so I use shrimp paste instead, along with beef and squid.
Still, the flavor of this bun quay remains rich and comforting — every time I cook it, I can’t help but feel a wave of homesickness for Saigon.

      <p class="hf-subtitle">A truly “American-style” hu tieu — because I just can’t find the same noodles as in Vietnam</p>
      <p class="hf-text">
       At the Asian markets around where I live, I haven’t been able to find the kind of hu tieu dot noodles like the ones I used to eat in Saigon.
Instead, I usually cook with the “Hu Tieu Viet Nam” noodles from the Ba Cay Tre Brand. I’ve never actually tried this brand back in Vietnam, so I’m not sure if the noodles there taste different, but after boiling, they seem more similar to pho noodles than to hu tieu.
My version of hu tieu is usually served with pork ribs, meatballs, shrimp, and quail eggs. The quail eggs can only be found at Asian or international markets — American grocery stores only sell chicken eggs.

      <p class="hf-subtitle">Thai hotpot — just a smaller version in a bowl</p>
      <p class="hf-text">
        The bun Thai I make is basically lau Thái (Thai hotpot), but since it’s just the two of us, I serve it in individual bowls instead — one for each of us, which makes it simpler and cozier.
For this dish, besides the usual toppings like shrimp, beef, and clams, I also like to add various hotpot meatballs for a bit more fun.
In Vietnam, this dish is usually served with morning glory (rau muong), but since I can’t find it in the U.S., I replace it with plenty of enoki mushrooms.
Back home, I used to dip it in green chili salt, but it’s hard to find that here, so I make my own red chili salt using bird’s eye chili, condensed milk, salt, MSG, lemon, and a bit of kaffir lemon leaf for extra aroma.

      <p class="hf-subtitle">A quick and simple noodle soup that’s still full of flavor</p>
      <p class="hf-text">
        Bun thit bo rau ram is the quickest noodle soup I make — it’s simple, yet surprisingly delicious.
I usually cook it on days when I don’t have much time but still want something warm and comforting.
All it takes are tomatoes, onions, Vietnamese coriander (ram ram), and beef to make a flavorful bowl of soup.
Rau ram can only be found at Asian or international markets — American grocery stores almost never have it.
The whole thing takes just about 30 minutes to make, so honestly, calling it “lazy noodles” wouldn’t be wrong at all.

      <p class="hf-subtitle">No matter how it’s cooked, it just wouldn’t feel right without that salt-and-chili dip made the Southwestern Vietnam way.</p>
      <p class="hf-text">
For this mien ga nam, I usually use deboned chicken thighs, pan-seared with a halved onion. Then, I add shallots and chili that I’ve pounded together in a mortar and pestle, sautéing them with brown shimeji mushrooms to make the broth.
Once the broth starts to boil, I season it with salt, chicken bouillon, rock sugar, soy sauce, and fish sauce. For this dish, soy sauce is absolutely essential — its aroma gives the broth a distinctive, savory depth that makes it incredibly flavorful.
I usually serve it with chopped cilantro and a small bowl of spicy salt-and-chili dip, made the Southwestern Vietnamese way — the perfect pairing for the tender chicken and warm, comforting soup.

        Nui thi vien is what I often make on rainy days.
When it rains, the weather gets colder, and I usually feel a bit lazier than usual. So when I crave something warm, quick, and comforting, nui thit vien is always my go-to choice.
Since it’s made with macaroni, you can easily eat it with just a spoon — no chopsticks needed like with pho, mi, or hu tieu.
I usually cook it with meatballs, shrimp, and quail eggs, add a few pieces of bok choy, then finish it off with green onions and cilantro — simple, cozy, and delicious.
