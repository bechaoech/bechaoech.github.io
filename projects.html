                    <br>We’re not the most outstanding students, nor are we anyone particularly special. But we did it — from two undergrads in Vietnam 🇻🇳 to now preparing to move to the U.S. 🇺🇸 together: one pursuing a PhD, the other walking alongside as a steady companion.

    As I shared in the About Me section, I studied Business Administration at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH), majoring in Quality Management. My husband, on the other hand, majored in Artificial Intelligence within the Computer Science program at the University of Information Technology (UIT), Ho Chi Minh City. We’re the same age, so our academic journeys were almost parallel—from freshman year all the way to graduation.
<br><br>I met him during the second semester of our first year. Back then, we were just two freshmen still trying to figure things out—questions like “What will we do after graduation?” or “Where are we heading?” felt distant and unanswered. We didn’t have any clear plans for the future. We simply studied together, helped each other out, and tried our best to grow a little more each day.
<br><br>My English was very weak at the time since I had no solid foundation, and the first few semesters were really challenging. He was the one who patiently taught me grammar, tenses, and sentence structures. In return, I helped him with general education courses—because he was so passionate about algorithms that he spent nearly all his time on them, often neglecting the other subjects. In that sense, we truly supported each other: he lifted me up in English, and I helped him keep up with the rest.
<br><br>We also had a little “tradition” — we set academic goals for each other, both short-term and long-term. Whoever failed to meet their goal had to “pay the price”: go pick the other person up and treat them to a meal. It was a fun challenge, but in the end, it kept us both motivated to improve day by day.
<br><br>As a result, we both graduated early and earned our degrees with distinction.

    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      About six months before graduation, my husband started his first job at VinAI as an AI Research Resident. It was during this time that the first thoughts about pursuing a PhD began to take shape. He realized that if he wanted to go further in the field of Artificial Intelligence, building a strong academic foundation would help him connect more deeply with experts in the field and open doors to meaningful involvement in cutting-edge projects at major tech companies.
      <br><br>At first, the idea of pursuing a PhD was just something he casually mentioned during one of our meals together. But gradually, I began to see a shift — the way he talked about it, the way he researched and started laying out a plan — it became clear to me that this was no longer just a fleeting thought.
      <br><br>Around a year and a half before the intended start of his PhD, he sat down with me to seriously discuss the idea of applying. And that’s when our real journey began.
      <br><br>What made me feel that putting my own career on hold to fully support him was the right decision, was when he seriously talked to his family about wanting to marry me, and requested that they hold an engagement ceremony so he could have the legal status to walk this next chapter of life with me — as husband and wife.
      <br><br>He also clearly told me:
      <br><br>“I will only apply to universities in countries where you can come with me. If you can’t, then I won’t go.”
      <br><br>There were no dramatic promises, no poetic “wait for me” speeches like in the movies — just a calm, clear conviction. And that was exactly what gave me full trust in him — not because of what he said, but because of what he did.
      <br><br>At the time, I felt we were still a bit young to have a wedding, so I suggested we just have a formal engagement and register our marriage first. I’ve always wanted us to save our wedding ceremony for when we return — more mature, more experienced — so we could celebrate it with full meaning and joy.
      <br><br>Once everything was in place, he resumed his research at VinAI. As for me, I chose not to work and devoted all my time and energy to supporting him in his endeavors.

      Our journey began with the smallest of thoughts — when my husband first brought up the idea of pursuing a PhD at one of the world’s top universities. Back then, neither of us had a clear picture of what was to come: dozens of emails to professors, countless late nights refining his Statement of Purpose, and the anxious wait for each round of responses from schools. We didn’t have a roadmap or an overall plan — everything was completely new to us. But step by step, through endless research, learning, trial and error, and constantly encouraging each other, we slowly moved closer to something we once only dared to dream of: receiving an offer of admission, holding two visas in our hands, and getting ready to fly to the U.S. to begin an entirely new chapter of our lives. This post is a record of that journey — not just to preserve a meaningful memory for us, but also to serve as a practical guide for anyone who is taking their first steps toward applying for a PhD and preparing to study abroad alongside the one they love.

      Although we had serious conversations about pursuing a PhD more than a year before the actual start date, at that time we were still very unclear about how the application process worked — from writing the SOP, contacting professors, to preparing financial documents. Honestly, we had no concrete preparations in the early stages.
After our engagement ceremony, he focused entirely on his research and writing papers for conferences, while I concentrated on improving my English. As a result, the whole PhD application process was… pretty much left untouched.
It wasn’t until August 2024 that I finally opened the admissions websites of different universities for the first time and began learning everything from scratch.

      <strong><em>"Why do you want to pursue a PhD?"</em></strong> — that was the very first question both of us had to seriously reflect on together. <br>
<br>At first, he simply said he wanted to do a PhD to gain the opportunity to work in a more research-focused environment. But gradually, after many conversations, he came to realize that his true motivation stemmed from a desire to become a researcher who could make long-term contributions — not just someone solving short-term problems in industry.
<br><br>Another reason was his wish to build a strong academic foundation, enabling him to connect more effectively with the academic community and open doors to top research labs at major tech companies like Google, Meta, or NVIDIA... A PhD, he realized, would not only grant him academic credibility but also allow greater freedom in choosing research directions — something difficult to achieve in most engineering roles.
<br><br>Once the “why” was clear, we moved on to the next big question:
 <br><strong><em>“What do you want to research over the next 4–5 years?”</em></strong>
<br><br>We looked back at his background. At the time, he already had some experience in AI and Computer Vision, especially from his research projects at VinAI. That made directions like 3D Vision, Multimodal Learning, and Robotics a logical and meaningful path to follow. We agreed that the goal would be to apply to professors and labs that specialize in Computer Vision and Robotics — places that could help him dive deeper into these fields and grow in line with his long-term vision.
<br><br>Finally, after identifying both the purpose of pursuing a PhD and the research direction, we sat down to analyze his background using the SWOT framework (Strengths – Weaknesses – Opportunities – Threats).
 This helped us clearly see what strengths to leverage, what weaknesses to address, and what opportunities to focus our efforts on.
 That step turned out to be essential — it laid the foundation for writing a compelling Statement of Purpose later on.

    </h4>    
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      After defining our PhD goals and research direction, we moved on to the next stage: choosing schools, countries, and identifying professors to apply to. This was one of the most crucial steps — because applying to top-ranked schools isn’t necessarily the best strategy. What truly matters is applying to places where there are professors whose research aligns with ours and who are actively looking for PhD students that year.
We divided the tasks between us based on our strengths. I was in charge of researching the admissions requirements of each school and country — including degree prerequisites, GPA, English proficiency (IELTS/TOEFL), GRE (if applicable), tuition fees, and funding policies. I also considered visa-related conditions, prioritizing countries where I could easily accompany him as a dependent.
After narrowing down the options, we realized that the U.S. was the most suitable choice. The visa process was more favorable, the academic environment was strong, the schools had high rankings, and — most importantly — the post-graduation career opportunities were promising. Based on that, we decided to focus on schools ranked in the Top 20 U.S. institutions according to CSRankings (2019–2024).
<br><br>I created a detailed Google Sheet to compile all relevant information: admissions requirements, tuition, English and GRE expectations, application deadlines, and fees. Meanwhile, he was responsible for finding suitable professors and labs. He kept track of important details such as the relevance of the research topics, whether the professor was actively recruiting, and signs that the lab was open to new students.
<br><br>Here’s how we conducted the lab search:
</p>
<div class="indented-steps">
<br>1. Visited each department’s faculty directory (usually in Computer Science or Robotics), and cross-referenced with CSRankings.
<br>2. Checked if the professor was currently accepting PhD students — often noted on the professor’s website or social media (like LinkedIn, X).
<br>3. Read lab descriptions and recent projects to see if they aligned with our interests.
<br>4. Reviewed the most recent papers — since labs often have multiple members working on different topics, we had to filter for the work most relevant to us.
<br>5. Assessed the size of each lab by the number of current PhD students, and reviewed their profiles to see what kind of academic background they had before joining — for comparison with our own.
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<br>If the lab seemed like a good fit, he would record it in the shared Google Sheet I had created — including the professor’s name, lab name, website, research keywords, and status of email contact. That sheet helped us manage data from 20 different schools in an organized, stress-free way.
<br><br>Although reading through countless lab websites and professor profiles was tiring at first, we gradually realized something important: applying to the right lab is more important than applying to many. So instead of casting a wide net, we focused only on the places that truly felt like a match — where the professor was responsive, the research direction was clear, and the academic environment fit our long-term goals.

    <span class="goal-title" id="section4">4. Preparing Academic Documents</span>
  </h4>    
  <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    In this phase, we prepared all the materials that are commonly required in most PhD applications, including: CV, SOP (Statement of Purpose), PS (Personal Statement), LORs (Letters of Recommendation), IELTS certificate, academic transcript, and diploma. This stage not only required precision and completeness, but also served as a crucial opportunity to showcase the applicant’s academic ability, research direction, and compatibility with the program.
    <br><br>We continued to divide our work clearly: he was responsible for writing the content, while I focused on strategy and overall structure — from brainstorming, outlining, and providing writing direction, to proofreading and finalizing the documents.
    <br><br>At the time, he was in the final stretch of completing some unfinished papers, so he prioritized finalizing them to include in his application. However, for key documents like the CV, SOP, PS, and LORs, he still did the primary writing — because only he truly understood his own strengths, academic goals, and how they aligned with specific professors and labs.
    <br><br>As for me, I handled the following:
    <div class="indented-steps">
    <ul>
    <li>Brainstormed and outlined the CV, SOP, PS, and each letter of recommendation</li>
    <li>Drafted LORs tailored to each school and professor</li>
    <li>Reached out to mentors early to ask for letters with ample time</li>
    <li>After he completed the core writing, I took care of formatting, error-checking, and polishing each document before submission</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h4 class="subsection-title"><strong>CV (Curriculum Vitae)</strong></h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
  We wrote all application documents in LaTeX to ensure professionalism, cleanliness, and consistency in formatting — except for the Drafts LOR, which were written in Google Docs for easy back-and-forth feedback. The CV focused on academic components: research projects, publications, awards, and technical skills. I also studied many CV samples from current PhD students to better understand how to highlight strengths effectively.<a href="https://phucnda.github.io/assets/docs/phucnda_CV.pdf" class="sample-link"><strong><em></em> Sample CV</em></strong></a></p>
  <h4 class="subsection-title"><strong>SOP (Statement of Purpose)</strong></h4>
  <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    This was the hardest and most critical part of the application. We spent a huge amount of time writing, revising, discussing, and rewriting it again and again. A strong SOP needs to convey:
  </p>
    <div class="indented-steps">
      <ul>
    <li>Long-term academic and research goals</li>
    <li>Why you want to pursue a PhD and your specific research direction</li>
    <li>How your personal experiences connect to your academic path</li>
    <li>Why you chose this university and these specific professors/labs</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    In reality, the admissions committee doesn’t know you — they’ve never met, spoken to, or worked with you. The SOP is the first and only place where they can get to know you through your writing. But they also read hundreds of applications a day, so your SOP must be concise yet deep, clear but not boring, and sharply focused.
    <br><br>One thing we kept reminding ourselves — and now I’ll say it three times to anyone writing their SOP:
    </p>
    <div class="indented-steps sop-warning">
      <ul>
     <li><strong>Do not use the same SOP for every school.</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Do not use the same SOP for every school.</strong></li>
     <li><strong>Do not use the same SOP for every school.</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    Each school and each lab has different expectations, styles, and research directions. That’s why customizing and tailoring each SOP is not optional — even if it’s a lot of work, it’s absolutely worth it. <a href="assets/docs/sop.pdf" class="sample-link" target="_blank"><strong><em></em> Sample SOP</em></strong></a></p>
    <h4 class="subsection-title"><strong>PS (Personal Statement)</strong></h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    Only a few schools required PS, as most only asked for an SOP. If a school did request a PS, we treated it as a space to share the personal side of the story — the experiences that shaped the academic journey, personal growth over time, and values that aligned with a research environment.
    <bt><br>I viewed the PS as a kind of emotional map that made the application less dry and more human.
     Do you remember the SWOT analysis we did in Section 2?
     We used our Strengths and Opportunities in the SOP, and our Weaknesses and Threats in the PS — a perfectly complementary strategy.<br><a href="assets/docs/ps.pdf" class="sample-link" target="_blank"><strong><em></em> Sample PS</em></strong></a></p>
     <h4 class="subsection-title"><strong>Letters of Recommendation (LORs)</strong></h4>
     <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      We reached out to our mentors quite early, but we only sent them the Drafts LOR after the SOP was fully completed. That’s because only after finalizing the SOP could I clearly see the overall narrative of his profile and determine what should be highlighted in the recommendation letters — things that the applicant himself shouldn’t say directly, but could be confirmed by a trusted third party.
    <br><br>If the SOP is where the applicant speaks for themselves, then the LOR is where the mentor validates those claims.
    Most PhD applications require three letters of recommendation. So we prepared three separate drafts, each highlighting a different aspect of his strengths:</p>
    <div class="indented-steps">
      <ul>
   <li>Writer X focused on research capability</li>
  <li>Writer Y emphasized teamwork and proactivity</li>
    <li>Writer Z highlighted persistence, resilience, and a growth mindset</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      This approach gave the admissions committee a more multidimensional and complete picture of the applicant, rather than reading three letters that repeat the same points.
      <p class="lor-subheading text-left">What is an Draft LOR and Why Should You Prepare One?</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    Mentors — whether they are professors, advisors, or supervisors — are typically very busy people. They also work with many students and colleagues at the same time. Even if you’ve worked closely with them on several projects in the past, over time, it’s natural that they may not remember all the details of what you did, how you performed, or what made you stand out.
    That’s where an Draft LOR comes in. It’s a summary of your contributions, milestones, and key qualities written by you, based on real experiences during your time working with the mentor. Preparing a draft doesn’t just save them time — it also ensures the content is accurate, relevant, and well-aligned with your application goals, because you’ve already gathered all the important information for them in advance.
    <br><br>After finishing the draft, I sent it along with clear notes, so that the mentor could easily revise it as they see fit, or simply approve and sign it if they agreed with the content.
   <br><br>Thanks to this level of preparation, the LOR process went smoothly for us — the letters were personalized, targeted, and reflected the applicant’s actual strengths. Most importantly, we didn’t take up much of the mentors’ time — something we deeply appreciated. After all, just having them agree to write the letter is already a huge favor.<br><a href="assets/docs/lorx.pdf" class="sample-link" target="_blank"><strong><em></em> Sample Draft LOR X</em></strong></a> |<a href="assets/docs/lory.pdf" class="sample-link" target="_blank"><strong><em></em> Sample Draft LOR Y</em></strong></a> |<a href="assets/docs/lorz.pdf" class="sample-link" target="_blank"><strong><em></em> Sample Draft LOR Z</em></strong></a></p>

  </h4>    
  <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    After completing all required documents, we moved on to the application submission phase — which, although it might sound simple, turned out to be quite stressful. Each school has its own system, unique requirements, and small details that can easily be overlooked without a solid tracking strategy.
    <br><br>To stay organized, we created two main tracking systems:
    <p class="lor-subheading text-left">1. Organizing Applications by School</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    We set up a main Google Drive folder called "Application Package", with a separate subfolder for each university — such as CMU, UC Berkeley, UMD, etc.
    Inside each folder, we uploaded all submitted materials, including the school-specific versions of the CV, SOP, LORs, transcripts, degree certificates, and confirmation emails.
    <br><br>This system allowed us to quickly check what we had submitted to each school, especially helpful if any issues arose (e.g., a missing file or last-minute verification request).
    <p class="lor-subheading text-left">2. Tracking LOR and Submission Status</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      To keep everything organized during the hectic submission period, I created a master <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wm9l-xhGfNGG4HvNsaEepVcDxbkGg15o7Z1LV7H6eOM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="sample-link"><strong><em>Google Sheet</em></strong></a> to track the progress of all applications. I updated it daily to make sure no steps were missed.
      <br><br>In addition, we prepared <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11sDRDtVADIhZcdeow5oLCznHzk-4agrLhdrhpDhNDoU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="sample-link"><strong><em>individual tracking sheets</em></strong></a> for each recommender. These sheets made it easy for them to know which schools required letters, what the deadlines were, and whether the requests had been sent — all without needing to check in with us repeatedly. 
      <br><br>This approach helped minimize back-and-forth and reduced the burden on our recommenders, especially given the tight timeline and number of schools involved.

      <span class="goal-title" id="section6">6. Cold Emailing Professors and Labs After Submission</span>
    </h4>    
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      After submitting all PhD applications, we began sending cold emails to professors whose labs my husband had applied to. While many applicants choose to reach out before submitting their applications, we intentionally waited until after submission — so that professors could directly look up his name in the application system if they were interested.
      <br><br>We were very clear about our approach:
      <div class="indented-steps">
        <ul>
     <li>We only emailed professors whose research directions truly aligned with his, and only those listed in the submitted application forms (as most schools allow you to name 3–4 faculty members).</li>
    <li>Each email was highly personalized, explaining specifically why his background and research goals matched the lab's direction. We absolutely avoided sending generic or copy-pasted messages</li>
      <li>We sent emails within 1–2 weeks after submission, ensuring they wouldn’t arrive too late, while still being timely as professors began reviewing applications.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      Each email included:
      <div class="indented-steps">
        <ul>
     <li>A brief self-introduction (academic background and recent research experience)</li>
    <li>A mention that he had submitted his PhD application and expressed interest in joining the professor’s lab</li>
      <li>A specific point of connection (e.g., a paper he had read or a project he was excited about)</li>
      <li>Attached materials: CV + personal website link</li>
      <li>A polite thank-you and an expression of interest in hearing back</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      He drafted each email himself, and I helped review and edit every line — from grammar and phrasing to tone — to make sure each message was concise, respectful, and thoughtful. There were times we spent over 30 minutes crafting just a few short sentences, simply because we wanted the email to be considerate of the professor’s time and attention.
      <br><br>Not every email received a response — and we understood that. But a few professors did respond positively, confirming they had seen his application and would review it carefully. Some even mentioned that they would recommend his file to the admissions committee, or invited him to a lab interview shortly after reading his email.
      <br><br>So even though cold emailing after submission may seem late to some, when done correctly, it can still be a meaningful and strategic way to stand out, show genuine interest, and demonstrate your readiness to collaborate.

Dear Professor X,

My name is Phuc Nguyen Duc Anh and I am writing to express my strong interest in joining your lab as a Ph.D. student in Fall 2025, as I deeply admire your research on 2D perception and video understanding. I am an AI Research Engineer at [ABC], with two years of prior experience as an AI Research Resident at [DEF]. I have applied to the Ph.D. program at the Department of Computer Science and mentioned your name in my Statement of Purpose, as I believe my research interests closely align with your lab's focus. I believe my skills and experiences would enable me to make meaningful contributions to your research ongoing and future projects. I am reaching out to explore whether I might be a good fit for your lab starting in Fall 2025.

I am curious to know if you are currently considering applications for new Ph.D. students in Fall 2025 and whether my background aligns with your lab's goals.

A little bit about myself: I am passionate about advancing machines' ability to understand and interact with the physical world through natural language. My research focuses on enabling machines to perceive their surroundings as humans do, which I believe is crucial for achieving a fine-grained understanding of 3D environments. To this end, I have conducted extensive studies on 3D segmentation using natural language descriptions, culminating in one paper accepted at CVPR’24, two papers currently under submission, and two workshop winnings (ICCV’23, CVPR’24). These accomplishments have provided me with a strong foundation in 3D computer vision, image and scene understanding.

Moreover, recent breakthroughs in multimodal Large Language Models (M-LLMs) have inspired me to explore their integration into my work. In one of my projects, I utilized M-LLMs to tokenize 3D scene representations, enhancing their reasoning capabilities for detailed analysis. My expertise in computer vision and my skills in leveraging state-of-the-art techniques equip me to make meaningful contributions to your lab's research. Furthermore, I am also eager to learn and explore new research directions that can have a significant impact on the world today.

For more details, please find my resume attached and my project page: <a href="https://phucnda.github.io" class="sample-link" target="_blank"><strong><em>phucnda.github.io</em></strong></a>

I would greatly appreciate your feedback on whether you are currently accepting students for Fall 2025 and whether my background aligns with your lab’s research. I’m happy if we could arrange a brief online meeting or call to discuss my suitability for your lab and potential research directions under your supervision. Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best Regards,  
PhucNDA

      <span class="goal-title" id="section7">7. Receiving Results and Choosing the Right School</span>
    </h4>    
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      After months of submitting applications, sending emails, and responding to professors, we finally started receiving the first admission results from the schools. Due to the time difference, most schools sent out decisions around 2–4 AM Vietnam time, so almost every night, my husband and I stayed up until after 4 AM just to wait for any news.
The feeling during that time was indescribable — anxious, hopeful, and nervous all at once. We had poured so much effort, endured so many sleepless nights, and dealt with constant stress throughout the entire process, and we couldn’t help but wonder whether it would all pay off.
I remember it clearly: the first five schools that responded were all rejections. Each night, while we were working, the sound of a Gmail notification would make our hearts skip a beat. The moment we saw a school name appear in the inbox, our hearts raced — only to open the message and find it began with the words, “We regret to inform you…”
Night after night, we checked our emails in silence, exchanged glances, sighed — and then reminded each other:
 <br><strong>“It’s okay. One right opportunity is enough.”</strong>
Truthfully, we had mentally prepared ourselves for any outcome. So while the disappointment was real, we didn’t let it break us. I’ve always believed that results don’t define our worth. And sometimes, closed doors exist only to make way for the right one to open at the right time.
<br><br>And eventually, it did.<br><br>
Around early February, my husband received his first offer — from the <strong>University of Maryland, College Park</strong> <span class="umd-color"><strong>(UMD)</strong></span>. What made this case special was that we had only sent a cold email to the professor, who responded saying that my husband’s profile was a strong fit for the lab. The professor promised to recommend his file to the admissions committee. Not long after, we received the official offer — without even an interview.
<br><br>The very next day, he got an interview invitation from a lab at the <strong>University of California - San Diego</strong> <span class="ucsd-color"><strong>(UCSD)</strong></span>, a school we had applied to earlier. Since there wasn’t much time to prepare, we only had the chance to go through a few common questions. I still remember clearly: the first interview was with current PhD students in the lab and lasted about 45 minutes. A week later, he had a one-on-one interview with the professor, which lasted an hour.
But things didn’t always go smoothly. We happened to apply during a period of political instability, and many schools were affected by funding cuts, which severely impacted several labs’ admissions decisions. Around two weeks after the interview, the professor from UCSD informed us that due to funding issues, the lab would not be able to take on any new PhD students that year.
<br><br>A similar situation happened with a professor at the <strong>University of Texas at Austin</strong> <span class="ut-austin-color"><strong>(UT Austin)</strong></span>. We had also sent a cold email and received a very warm response — the professor said he would recommend the application to the admissions committee to see if any other lab in the department might be able to take my husband.
He even shared that he was genuinely impressed with the profile and would have loved to admit him — but unfortunately, the funding proposal he submitted that year was not approved. So despite his willingness, he had no choice but to decline taking on a new PhD student for this cycle.
We felt disappointed, of course — but also deeply grateful. Even though the outcome wasn’t what we hoped for, we still felt seen and respected. It meant a lot to know that the effort we had poured into this process was truly recognized.
<p class="lor-subheading text-left">The Final Decision</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
 In the end, we accepted the offer from University of Maryland, College Park <span class="umd-color"><strong></strong>(UMD)</strong></span> — not because it was the most “prestigious” school, but because it was the most suitable one for us. It was the place where the professor truly aligned with my husband’s research interests, where the lab focused on exactly the topics he was passionate about, where there was a strong academic community, and most importantly, where we could start this new chapter of our lives together.
Choosing a school is a big decision, but we have no regrets — because we had set our priorities clearly from the beginning, and we made our choice based on what mattered most to us, not to anyone else.

      <span class="goal-title" id="section8">8. Preparing the F-1 and F-2 Visa Applications</span>
    </h4>    
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      After officially choosing a school and receiving the admission offer, we moved on to the next stage: applying for our U.S. visas. For us, this wasn’t just a personal administrative step — it was a shared journey. My husband applied for an F-1 visa (international student), and I applied as his dependent under the F-2 visa category.
      <p class="lor-subheading text-left">Step 1: Receiving the I-20 from the University</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
As soon as we confirmed enrollment with UMD, we followed the school’s instructions to request the Form I-20 for both of us:
<div class="indented-steps">
  <ul>
<li>His I-20 (F-1): For the PhD program</li>
<li>My I-20 (F-2): As the accompanying dependent</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="lor-subheading text-left">What the university required:</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <div class="indented-steps">
      <ul>
    <li>Passport information for both of us</li>
    <li>Financial documentation: Since my husband was a Direct PhD student, his tuition was fully waived and he received a monthly stipend. That stipend alone was sufficient to sponsor both of us, so we didn’t need to show any extra savings — just submitting the Assistantship Offer Letter was enough.</li>
    <li>Information for the F-2 dependent</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
After about 3–5 business days, we received our official I-20s via email.
<p class="lor-subheading text-left">Step 2: Paying the SEVIS Fee</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <div class="indented-steps">
          <ul>
        <li>F-1: $350</li>
        <li>F-2: No SEVIS fee required, but the SEVIS ID from the I-20 must still be entered in the DS-160</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
We paid the fee using an international credit card and saved the receipt for our visa interview.
<p class="lor-subheading text-left">Step 3: Completing the DS-160 Forms</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
This part required careful consideration — because having a spouse accompany the student under an F-2 visa can make the case more complex in the eyes of the visa officer. So we made sure everything was accurate and well-reasoned.
<div class="indented-steps">
  <ul>
<li>Each of us completed a separate DS-160 form</li>
<li>We used the exact SEVIS ID from the I-20</li>
<li>For the U.S. address: At that time, we hadn’t officially signed a lease yet, so we used the university’s address</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
Once completed, we saved the PDF confirmations and Application IDs to schedule our interview appointments.
<p class="lor-subheading text-left">Step 4: Booking the Interview and Preparing Documents</p>
<div class="indented-steps">
  <ul>
<li>We scheduled the visa interview through the official U.S. Embassy/Consulate website in Vietnam</li>
<li>After paying the MRV visa fee, we booked the same appointment time to attend the interview together</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <p class="lor-subheading text-left">Documents we prepared:</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    <div class="indented-steps">
      <ul>
    <li>Printed I-20s (both F-1 and F-2)</li>
    <li>DS-160 confirmation pages</li>
    <li>Passport-style photos</li>
    <li>Valid passports
      <li>Admission letter from the university</li>
      <li>Original marriage certificate</li>
      <li>Financial proof (the assistantship letter was sufficient in our case)</li>
      <li>CV, transcript, and diploma (for the F-1 applicant)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p class="lor-subheading text-left">Step 5: The Interview</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
We arrived on time, dressed formally, and brought all the necessary documents. The visa officer conducted the interview in English, asking my husband about his program and financial situation. He also asked a few questions about me — but I wasn’t interviewed directly as the F-2 dependent.
Thanks to our preparation, the interview went smoothly. At the end, the officer kept both passports and informed us that our visas had been approved. The very next day, we received our passports with the visa stamps delivered to our home.
<p class="lor-subheading text-left">Final Thoughts</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
Preparing the visa application is the final — but one of the most important — steps of the PhD journey. Even with an admission offer in hand, your dream doesn’t begin until you’re granted that visa.
<br>For us, it was the combination of thorough preparation, honesty, and teamwork that helped both of us get approved on the very first try.

    </h4>    
    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      After receiving our visas, we entered the final stage before officially beginning our journey in the U.S.: finding a place to live and preparing for the move. Even though we had already overcome most of the major challenges — from applying, interviewing, and receiving admission offers to getting our visas approved — this last phase was still an important one, requiring careful planning and attention to detail.
<br><br>Since this would be our first time living abroad, we prioritized housing that was close to campus, located in a safe area, part of a supportive international student community, and preferably furnished or semi-furnished to minimize the need for shopping right after arrival. After researching and comparing many options — from off-campus rentals to graduate student housing — we decided to go with a university-recommended apartment complex specifically for graduate students. The decision came down to several reasons: the units came with essential amenities like air conditioning, a kitchen, a refrigerator, heating, and hot water. The leasing process was transparent, contracts were clear, and the management was experienced in supporting international students. Most importantly, all utility costs — electricity, water, gas, and more — were included in the rent, which made it easier for us to manage our expenses during the transition period.
<br><br>Once the lease was signed, we began packing our luggage. This turned out to be a challenge in itself, as we had to factor in climate differences between Vietnam and the U.S., as well as the airline baggage restrictions. We carefully prepared and organized all essential documents: passports, I-20s, admission letters, DS-160 confirmations, transcripts, and diplomas — and kept them in an accessible folder for border entry. We also packed basic medicine, some dry foods like instant noodles, pho, and Vietnamese spices for the first few days, and essential electronics like plug adapters, power banks, laptops, and headphones.
<br><br>We booked our flights about three months before departure to have more options and peace of mind. We chose an itinerary with reasonable layovers, sufficient checked baggage allowance, and arrival at the nearest airport to our school — in our case, <strong>Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD)</strong>.
<br><br>And finally, the most important thing we prepared — was our mindset. You might not think of it this way, but among all the things you pack, mental readiness is the most essential. Leaving home, being away from family, and stepping into an unfamiliar environment can be overwhelming at times. There will be moments of confusion, discomfort, or doubt. But we kept reminding each other: this was the path we chose together — a dream we had worked hard for. And now that it’s truly beginning, we’ll face whatever comes next, side by side.
