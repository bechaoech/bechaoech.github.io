                    <br>We’re not the most outstanding students, nor are we anyone particularly special. But we did it — from two undergrads in Vietnam 🇻🇳 to now preparing to move to the U.S. 🇺🇸 together: one pursuing a PhD, the other walking alongside as a steady companion.

  <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
    As I shared in the About Me section, I studied Business Administration at the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City (UEH), majoring in Quality Management. My husband, on the other hand, majored in Artificial Intelligence within the Computer Science program at the University of Information Technology (UIT), Ho Chi Minh City. We’re the same age, so our academic journeys were almost parallel—from freshman year all the way to graduation.
<br><br>I met him during the second semester of our first year. Back then, we were just two freshmen still trying to figure things out—questions like “What will we do after graduation?” or “Where are we heading?” felt distant and unanswered. We didn’t have any clear plans for the future. We simply studied together, helped each other out, and tried our best to grow a little more each day.
<br><br>My English was very weak at the time since I had no solid foundation, and the first few semesters were really challenging. He was the one who patiently taught me grammar, tenses, and sentence structures. In return, I helped him with general education courses—because he was so passionate about algorithms that he spent nearly all his time on them, often neglecting the other subjects. In that sense, we truly supported each other: he lifted me up in English, and I helped him keep up with the rest.
<br><br>We also had a little “tradition” — we set academic goals for each other, both short-term and long-term. Whoever failed to meet their goal had to “pay the price”: go pick the other person up and treat them to a meal. It was a fun challenge, but in the end, it kept us both motivated to improve day by day.
<br><br>As a result, we both graduated early and earned our degrees with honors. Finishing school ahead of schedule turned out to be a big advantage — it gave us extra time to thoroughly prepare for the graduate school application process.

      About six months before graduation, my husband started his first job at VinAI as an AI Research Resident. It was during this time that the first thoughts about pursuing a PhD began to take shape. He realized that if he wanted to go further in the field of Artificial Intelligence, building a strong academic foundation would help him connect more deeply with experts in the field and open doors to meaningful involvement in cutting-edge projects at major tech companies.
      <br><br>At first, the idea of pursuing a PhD was just something he casually mentioned during one of our meals together. But gradually, I began to see a shift — the way he talked about it, the way he researched and started laying out a plan — it became clear to me that this was no longer just a fleeting thought.
      <br><br>Around a year and a half before the intended start of his PhD, he sat down with me to seriously discuss the idea of applying. And that’s when our real journey began.
      <br><br>What made me feel that putting my own career on hold to fully support him was the right decision, was when he seriously talked to his family about wanting to marry me, and requested that they hold an engagement ceremony so he could have the legal status to walk this next chapter of life with me — as husband and wife.
      <br><br>He also clearly told me:
      <br><br>“I will only apply to universities in countries where you can come with me. If you can’t, then I won’t go.”
      <br><br>There were no dramatic promises, no poetic “wait for me” speeches like in the movies — just a calm, clear conviction. And that was exactly what gave me full trust in him — not because of what he said, but because of what he did.
      <br><br>At the time, I felt we were still a bit young to have a wedding, so I suggested we just have a formal engagement and register our marriage first. I’ve always wanted us to save our wedding ceremony for when we return — more mature, more experienced — so we could celebrate it with full meaning and joy.
      <br><br>Once everything was settled, he returned to his research work at VinAI. As for me, I decided not to work, and instead dedicated all my time and energy to supporting him through the entire PhD application process — from researching schools and professors, to drafting his SOP, preparing documents, and booking the visa appointments...

    <p style="text-align: justify; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
      Our journey began with the smallest of thoughts — when my husband first brought up the idea of pursuing a PhD at one of the world’s top universities. Back then, neither of us had a clear picture of what was to come: dozens of emails to professors, countless late nights refining his Statement of Purpose, and the anxious wait for each round of responses from schools. We didn’t have a roadmap or an overall plan — everything was completely new to us. But step by step, through endless research, learning, trial and error, and constantly encouraging each other, we slowly moved closer to something we once only dared to dream of: receiving an offer of admission, holding two visas in our hands, and getting ready to fly to the U.S. to begin an entirely new chapter of our lives. This post is a record of that journey — not just to preserve a meaningful memory for us, but also to serve as a practical guide for anyone who is taking their first steps toward applying for a PhD and preparing to study abroad alongside the one they love.
